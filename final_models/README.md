# Pretrained segment-level autoencoder models

These are the models we trained for our paper. The models can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1McPQvnjARCxBPvl4sPDRM2hQqlsVNF5K/view?usp=sharing).  

All these models were built on keras. Use the model.summary commands to examine the architectures. Contact somandep@usc.edu for access.
