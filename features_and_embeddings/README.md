# Features and Embeddings

The CVPR ads can be obtained from the authors' website and the Cannes Ads can be obtained from the Cannes website. Because the ads cannot be provided directly here, we have made the features and embeddings availble to replicate the baseline and the experiments detailed in the paper.  

In order to get access to the features, email somandep@usc.edu. The files are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HNV8KQZed8ccoeUcbSwcyLiSqzLqwebG?usp=sharing) but you would need access first.
